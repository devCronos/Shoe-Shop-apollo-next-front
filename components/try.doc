Hosting someone for a student exchange program can be a challenging, intimidating experience, but having a good plan and knowledge of your area and landmarks are a must. The exchange student is far from home and family and needs time, attention and a good deal of entertainment if you want to help him have the experience of a lifetime. Keeping all this in mind, it's best to prepare a schedule for your time together.

First of all I recommend spending lots of time outside the house. Where I live there are plenty of green parks to walk through, museums, the old city town center. Exploring these would give the student a sense of the general culture surrounding his new home.

Secondly I would suggest seeing a sporting event. Our town hosts good quality professional soccer games and watching supporters cheering for their team is always intriguing and plenty of fun.

Finally, there are lakes and landmarks to hike. For example, biking to the lake "Mihai Eminescu" is a one and a half a day long trip filled with rural scenery, perfect for taking photos and making great memories.


All things considered, a successful student exchange program should involve aspects of cultural exploration, entertainment and memory making and it would be wise to make sure your host has a plan for each of these aspects.
